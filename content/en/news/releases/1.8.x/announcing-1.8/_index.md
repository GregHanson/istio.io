## Istio's great community

As with all of our releases, Istio 1.8 was a community effort. 200 people
across over 40 companies contribute to Istio. We'd like to thank our fantastic
community for their ongoing efforts: it is because of our amazing community
that Istio is able to make so many improvements, quarter after quarter.
